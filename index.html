					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
					<!-- about you -->
                    <p>My great love for technology has been a driving force in my life and has led me to pursue a career in the IT industry. Ever since I was a child, I have been fascinated by the possibilities that technology presents, and I have always been eager to explore new advancements in the field. As a student, I remember staying up all night working on science congress projects, which we would then present at regional and national competitions.

                        As I have grown older, my passion for technology has only intensified, particularly when it comes to networks, cybersecurity, and the cloud. I am drawn to the ever-expanding digital world and am constantly inspired by the innovative solutions that technology can provide. I enjoy the process of learning new skills and applying them to troubleshoot current and future challenges in the industry.
                        
                        I firmly believe that in order to succeed in the tech space, it is important to stay current with the latest advancements and to continuously improve one's skills. I strive to be part of the steamroller of progress, rather than simply a bystander on the sidelines. With my expertise in networking, cybersecurity, and the cloud, I am eager to contribute to the growth and development of the technology industry, and I look forward to the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.</p>
